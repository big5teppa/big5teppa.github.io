### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 a favorite because I was having fun with it and was able to create gifs. I was able to create images and work color for the first time by using prngs, making a glittery effect and have a message displayed. 

* lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to obtain an understanding on how files worked and the role they play. I was able to create a guessing game that completely hides the number from player two by storing the number in a file.

* lab 1

    Lab 1 was my favorite because I was able to write code for the very first time. In the lab, I learned to print out statements and retrieve input using std::cout and std::in.
